# CA
Random bunch of matlab codes that implement a traditional CA (with a finite discrete state space) on Matlab, and collect specific statistics from trajectory of random configurations so as to automatically highlight interesting ruleset. The discussion and visulisation of rulespace is presented at http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=2315 under alias shouldsee.
CA1.m,CA2.m,rvCA.m are the major scripts that implement the for-loops.
The repository is messy and need some cleaning.
